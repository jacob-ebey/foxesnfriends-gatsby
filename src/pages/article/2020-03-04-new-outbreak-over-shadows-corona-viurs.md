SEATTLE, WA – Seattle has been at the heart of the west-coast outbreak of the COVID-19 (corona) virus striking fear into the hearts of the states residents as the death toll continues to rise above the 10,000 mark at an alarming rate.

In the panic of the COVID-19 virus, the residents have unknowingly contributed to an even greater pandemic of BMIFW-69 (being a misinformed fuckwit). COVID-19 has lead to an immediate increase if cases of xenophobic conspiracy theories and tales of false cures.

"The rise of BMIFW-69 has been sudden and we are not equipped as a community to deal with this threat at this time", says Professor Common Sense of the University of Washington.

“Our epidemiologists are working hard to identify idiot zero, but there might be more sporadic outbreaks of coronavirus-related imbecility,” added Professor Common Sense.

Meanwhile, health officials are dreading teaching the population a complicated prevention technique: washing your hands.
